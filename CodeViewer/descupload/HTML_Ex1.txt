#### **Overview**
This example showcases basic drawing to a HTML5 canvas element.
#### **The Canvas**
A canvas element is simply declared like this:
**Canvas Example:**
~~~
&#60;canvas id="a" width="300" height="300"&#62;&#60;/canvas&#62;
~~~
The width and height attributes sets the size of the element and the id is used to access it in the JavaScript code. In the code example this is done at line 64. 

To draw to the canvas we have to create a drawing context:
**Canvas Drawing Example:**
~~~
var acanvas=document.getElementById("a");
var context=acanvas.getContext("2d");
~~~
In the example to the right this is done at line 19. It is only possible to initialize one context per canvas element but we may have any number of canvas elements on the same page. It is even possible to have several canvas elements overlap each other. 

The follow example code shows how a simple filled rectangle may be drawn:
**fillRect Example:**
~~~
context.fillStyle="#ffff00";
context.fillRect(10,20,100,50);
~~~
This will draw a yellow rectangle at position 10,20 (x,y) with the width 100 and height 50. In the canvas element position 0,0 is found in the upper left corner. 

It is also possible to set the color using rgba as seen at line 44 and 48. This has the advantage that it makes it possible to set the opacity of that which is to be drawn. 

The code example to the right also shows how rectangles without fill are drawn and both how filled and unfilled text is drawn. The code example also shows how shadows can be added to things drawn to a canvas.
